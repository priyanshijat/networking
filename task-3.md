*#90daysofdevops – Week 1 Task 3: Launching an EC2 Instance*

## 💡 What is an EC2 Instance?

*EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)* is a virtual server running in the AWS cloud.  
Instead of owning physical hardware, AWS allows us to rent virtual machines on-demand.  
We only pay for what we use, and can *launch, stop, start, and terminate instances* within seconds.

---

## 🏠 Real-life Analogy:

Imagine *renting an apartment (EC2 instance)* in a *high-rise building (AWS Cloud)*.  
You can choose the *size, location, and features* (CPU, RAM, OS, etc.), and you *only pay while you use it*.

## 📌 Common Use Cases:

 ✅ Hosting web applications  
 ✅ Running backend services  
 ✅ Testing and development environments  
 ✅ Data processing
