# What is Ports and Protocols ?

**Protocol**:-    A protocol is a set of rules that define how data is transmitted and received over a network...

### There are some importand protocols used in Networking

- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):**   Used for web browsing  
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Used for transferring files  
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Used for sending emails  
- **TCP/IP:** The foundational protocol suite for the internet  
- **HTTPS (HyHyperText Transfer Protocol secure):** used for web browsing with encrypted data transfer
- **DNS (Domain Name Service):** used for translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** used for sending of emails between servers.
- **POP3 (Post Office Protocol):** Accessing and managing email on a client device
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** used to Assign IP addresses to device on a network dynamically.


**Ports**:- A port is a number assigned to a specific process or service on a device. It helps identify which application should handle incoming or outgoing data.

- *IP address* identifies the device.  
- *Port number* identifies the specific service/application on that device.
  

## *Examples:*

| Port Number | Service/Protocol            |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| 80          | HTTP (web traffic)          |
| 443         | HTTPS (secure web traffic)  |
| 21          | FTP (file transfer)         |
| 25          | SMTP (email sending)        |
| 53          | DNS (domain name resolution)|
| 22          | SSH (secure shell)          |
| 67 & 68     | DHCP (dynamic host control protocol)|

So when you visit a website like https://example.com, your browser uses *port 443* with the *HTTPS protocol* to securely connect.
when you send email then your device uses *port 25*
